# Genius glossaries explorer
https://genius-explorer.surge.sh/



Created as a pet project to practice React knowledge.

With this app you can explore various glossaries available through Genius.com API.

Apart from that, you can get a formatted version of the glossary to import it onto the Quizlet website in order to create a study set.

-------------------------------------------------------
## Motivation
The initial idea was to do the whole process (requesting glossary from the Genius API --> formatting --> sending it to the Quilzet API) by pressing one button; that is, to fully automate it.

To my disappointment, Quizlet shut down their APIs a couple of years ago, so now the users have to paste the formatted glossary into the Quizlet import window manually, following the instructions shown after successfully formatting the data.
